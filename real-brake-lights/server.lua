options
# option 1
- have another state on vehicle for whether it's in parked state
- set parked state after x time with randomness
- when in parked state, set brake lights to false
- getting out of vehicle sets parked state to true
  - this could possible ovverride the current system for disabling when there is no driver
  - or maybe old method can be adapted to trigger this?

# option 2
